# Get Going With Python and Flask

## Install Python, PIP, Virtualenv, etc:

If you are doing this on the EECS server machines we have assigned to you, all of this is already installed for you.

- [OSX Users](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/)
- [Windows Users](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/)
- [Linux Users](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/)

## Start the Virtualenv and Install Dependencies:

Run `virtualenv venv --distribute` this is going to create a safe place for you to install packages and run your app. Otherwise you need to install a package on your whole machine which can cause conflicts and horrible nightmares.

Then Run `source venv/bin/activate`. This step is important, and mostly magic. You need to run this command **every time you start developing** with a new terminal window. Otherwise your terminal will not be using the virtual environment and things will break. You should see something like `(venv)your-computer:python username$`. (This is slightly different on Windows, see above).

Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This only works correctly because I already gave you a `requirements.txt` file with the right dependencies. If you add a new dependency (like MySQLdb) simple run `pip install mysql-python`.

Unless you're lucky `pip install mysql-python` probably failed. Thats because you need to install `mysql` first. 

- On linux this should fix the problem:  
  `apt-get install build-essential python-dev libmysqlclient-dev`
- On Mac or Windows [read here](http://mysql-python.blogspot.com/2012/11/is-mysqldb-hard-to-install.html).
- On My Mac I ran `brew install  mysql` and then had to run `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/` because the link failed. Then I had to run `brew link mysql`. FINALLY `pip install mysql-python` worked just fine. :)

Whew, fun right? Welcome to web development, sometimes setting up tools is a huge pain.

## Run the Darn Thing:
You can simply run `python app.py` now and you'll have an app running!

Once you've gotten your app working fine run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to save your dependencies as they are. This way when your group mates pull your code they can just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` just like before!

## Deploy

To deploy this guy we need a WSGI server. You can run `gunicorn -b localhost:3000 -b localhost:3001 -w 4 app:app` this means the app will run with four workers, locally on two ports! You can drop the -w 4, its probably overkill for this class. If you are on your local machine, you can now visit the page by going to http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3001.

If you wanted to run this on the machine assigned to you, you have to provide the hostname of your machine instead of localhost. You can find your hostname by running the command "hostname" on the terminal. For example:

~ hostname
eecs485-10.eecs.umich.edu

Given this hostname, you can then run the command as gunicorn -b eecs485-10.eecs.umich.edu:3000 -b eecs485-10.eecs.umich.edu:3001 -w 4 app:app. Then you can look at your website by going to http://eecs485-10.eecs.umich.edu:3000.

If we were really going to deploy this app, we'd run this sucker behind a proxy server like `nginx` - kudos if you figure out how to do this. Nginx would do all the static files for us too. Luckily, Flask will host static files for you in '/static' feel free to put your '/pictures' folder here!

## Final Notes:

Take a look at this source code. If you want to do things a different way (for example use Django) go for it!
